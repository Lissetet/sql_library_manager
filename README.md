# Treehouse SQL Library Manager Project

This repository contains a web application I developed as part of the Treehouse Full Stack Techdegree program. It aims to help our local library efficiently manage its book collection. I implemented features to list, add, update, and delete books using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite, and Sequelize.

## Project Overview

In this project, I built a web application with the following features:

**List Books**: View a list of all books in our library's collection.
**Add Books**: Easily add new books to the database, complete with title, author, and other relevant details.
**Update Books**: Edit existing book information, ensuring our library's collection stays up-to-date.
**Delete Books**: Remove books that are no longer part of our collection.

## Technologies Used

I leveraged the following technologies to create a dynamic and user-friendly web application:

**JavaScript**: For building interactive and dynamic features.
**Node.js**: To run the server-side code.
**Express**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to handle routing and middleware.
**Pug**: A template engine for rendering HTML pages.
**SQLite**: A lightweight, file-based database used for data storage.
**Sequelize**: An SQL ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the SQLite database.
